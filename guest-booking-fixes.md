# Guest Booking System Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Urgency Field Text
- **Problem**: "3-5 business days" under standard selection
- **Fix**: Changed to "Normal scheduling" in `guest-booking.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Guest Jobs Not Appearing in Admin
- **Problem**: Guest bookings saved to separate collection
- **Fix**: Changed `guest-bookings` to `jobs` collection with proper fields:
  - Added `client`, `contactNumber`, `contactEmail` fields
  - Maintained `bookingType: 'guest'` for identification

### 3. ✅ Search Bar Navigation Error
- **Problem**: Router.replace causing navigation crashes
- **Fix**: Added try-catch error handling in `updateURL` function

### 4. ✅ Pending Filter Not Showing Guest Jobs
- **Fix**: Updated pending filter logic to include:
  - `job.bookingType === 'guest'`
  - Case-insensitive status matching
  - Proper NEW badge display for guest bookings

### 5. ✅ Guest Messages Not Flowing to Admin
- **Problem**: Guest messages saved to separate format
- **Fix**: Updated guest messaging to use conversation format:
  - Creates conversation in `conversations` collection
  - Saves messages in compatible format
  - Added "Guest Support" contact in admin messaging

## New Features Added:

### Guest Job Identification
- Guest jobs show "NEW" badge in admin jobs list
- `bookingType: 'guest'` field for filtering
- Proper pending status handling

### Improved Admin Messaging
- Guest Support contact appears in admin messaging
- Guest messages flow through standard conversation system
