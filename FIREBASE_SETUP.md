# Firebase Dynamic Content Setup

## Current Issues & Solutions

### 1. Job Progress Screen Access (Admin)
âœ… **FIXED**: Admins can now monitor employee job progress by:
- Going to Admin â†’ Employees tab
- Clicking "Monitor Job" on employees with active jobs
- Viewing real-time task completion and timer

### 2. Employee Data Integration
âœ… **FIXED**: Employee data now loads from Firebase `users` collection where `userType === 'employee'`

### 3. Real-Time Messaging System
âœ… **CREATED**: 
- Route: `/messaging` 
- Real-time chat using Firebase `messages` collection
- Admin can monitor all conversations in Admin â†’ Messages tab

### 4. Dynamic News Management
âœ… **CREATED**: 
- Admin can create/edit/delete news articles
- Stored in Firebase `news` collection
- No need to rebuild app for content updates

## Firebase Collections Structure

### Messages Collection
```javascript
{
  text: "Message content",
  senderId: "user_uid",
  senderName: "User Name", 
  createdAt: timestamp,
  type: "general"
}
```

### News Collection  
```javascript
{
  title: "Article Title",
  content: "Article content...",
  priority: "High|Medium|Normal|Low",
  author: "Admin",
  published: true,
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### Users Collection (Employee Data)
```javascript
{
  email: "employee@example.com",
  userType: "employee", // Important for filtering
  displayName: "Employee Name",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  status: "active|inactive"
}
```

### ðŸ”„ Images & Media (Future Enhancement)
For dynamic images (sliders, etc.), you can:
1. **Firebase Storage**: Upload images to Firebase Storage, store URLs in Firestore
2. **External CDN**: Use services like Cloudinary or AWS S3
3. **Admin Upload Interface**: Create admin screens to upload/manage media

## Required Firestore Rules Update
Add these rules to your Firebase Console:

```javascript
// Messages collection
match /messages/{messageId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}

// News collection  
match /news/{newsId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}
```
