# PR1: Navigation Cleanup + Array.isArray Guards

## Overview
This PR implements navigation cleanup and crash prevention guards for the admin tabs. The Jobs view already had locate-me functionality via the LiveMap component, so no additional porting was needed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Cleanup
**File**: `app/(admin-tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- Removed the hidden `news` tab completely from navigation
- Navigation now shows only 4 intended tabs: Dashboard, Jobs, Messages, Team
- Clean tab structure with proper icons and labels

### 2. Array.isArray Guards Added
**Files**: `jobs.tsx`, `employees.tsx`, `messaging.tsx`, `news.tsx`

#### jobs.tsx
- Protected job filtering operations (status, date, search)
- Added guards for employee location calculations
- Prevented crashes when jobs array is undefined/null

#### employees.tsx  
- Protected employee filtering by userType
- Added guards for job statistics calculations
- Protected active job filtering and employee job assignments

#### messaging.tsx
- Protected conversation filtering by type
- Added guards for unread count calculations
- Protected client chat counting

#### news.tsx
- Protected news filtering by publication status and priority
- Added guards for statistics calculations

### 3. Unit Tests Added
**Files**: 
- `__tests__/jobs-locate-me.test.tsx` - Tests locate-me functionality
- `__tests__/navigation.test.tsx` - Tests navigation structure and guards

### 4. Documentation Updated
**File**: `README.md`
- Added Jobs Map Locate-Me Feature section
- Added Navigation Cleanup section  
- Added Array.isArray Guards section
- Updated Manual QA Checklist with new test cases

## Locate-Me Functionality Status
✅ **Already Implemented**: The Jobs view was already using the LiveMap component with `showLocateButton={true}`, providing identical locate-me functionality to the Dashboard map.

**Features**:
- Permission handling with user-friendly alerts
- Error handling for denied permissions and location failures
- Visual feedback with loading states and pulse animation
- Map centering on user location
- Debounce protection against multiple requests

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- jobs-locate-me.test.tsx
npm test -- navigation.test.tsx
```

### Manual QA Checklist
1. **Navigation**: Verify only 4 tabs visible, no crashes
2. **Locate-me**: Test permission flow and error handling on Jobs map
3. **Array guards**: Test with undefined data, verify no .filter crashes
4. **Functionality**: Ensure all existing features still work

## Files Changed
- `app/(admin-tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Navigation cleanup
- `app/(admin-tabs)/jobs.tsx` - Array.isArray guards
- `app/(admin-tabs)/employees.tsx` - Array.isArray guards  
- `app/(admin-tabs)/messaging.tsx` - Array.isArray guards
- `app/(admin-tabs)/news.tsx` - Array.isArray guards
- `app/(admin-tabs)/README.md` - Documentation updates
- `app/(admin-tabs)/__tests__/jobs-locate-me.test.tsx` - New test
- `app/(admin-tabs)/__tests__/navigation.test.tsx` - New test

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ Jobs map has functional locate-me control identical to admin map  
✅ Bottom nav shows only the four intended tabs  
✅ No .filter crashes when clicking tabs or with undefined data  
✅ Unit tests cover locate-me behavior and navigation structure  
✅ README updated with new functionality and QA steps

## Next Steps
Ready for PR2: Messaging inbox skeleton + Jump-to-Job implementation.
