# Critical Fixes for MVP Launch - Teddy's Cleaning App

## 🚨 SECURITY FIXES (MUST DO BEFORE LAUNCH)

### 1. Remove Hardcoded Credentials
- [ ] Move Google Maps API key to environment variables
- [ ] Remove hardcoded passwords in scripts
- [ ] Secure Firebase service account key
- [ ] Use AWS Secrets Manager or similar

### 2. Fix Input Sanitization
- [ ] Sanitize all log inputs with `encodeURIComponent()`
- [ ] Validate user inputs before database operations
- [ ] Implement XSS protection

### 3. Authorization & Authentication
- [ ] Add proper auth checks to all routes
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Secure admin functions

## 🎯 CORE FUNCTIONALITY FIXES

### 1. Job Allocation System
**Current Issue**: No clear job assignment process
**Fix**: Create simple admin job assignment interface

```typescript
// Add to admin dashboard
const assignJobToEmployee = async (jobId: string, employeeId: string) => {
  await updateDoc(doc(db, "jobs", jobId), {
    assignedTo: employeeId,
    assignedAt: new Date(),
    status: "Assigned"
  });
};
```

### 2. Client Booking Interface
**Current Issue**: Book-service is IoT dashboard, not booking
**Fix**: Create simple booking form

**Replace book-service.tsx with:**
- Service type selection (House, Office, Deep Clean)
- Date/time picker
- Address input with Google Places
- Basic pricing display
- Simple submit button

### 3. Employee Job Management
**Current Issue**: Complex interface, location issues
**Fix**: Simplify to essential features only
- Today's jobs list
- Start/Complete job buttons
- Navigation to job location
- Photo upload for completion

## 🔧 UI/UX CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Onboarding Flow
**Fix the role selection and setup process:**

```typescript
// Simplified onboarding
1. Email verification (required)
2. Role selection (client/employee only, admin separate)
3. Basic profile setup
4. Direct to appropriate dashboard
```

### 2. Navigation Simplification
**Current**: Multiple tab systems causing confusion
**Fix**: Single navigation structure

```typescript
// Client tabs: Dashboard, Book Service, My Bookings, Messages, Profile
// Employee tabs: Dashboard, My Jobs, Schedule, Messages, Profile
// Admin: Separate admin panel access
```

### 3. Communication System
**Current**: Multiple chat systems, no real-time updates
**Fix**: Single unified messaging

```typescript
// Use Firebase Firestore for real-time messaging
// Remove Supabase chat complexity
// Integrate with notification service
```
