# Employee Data Cleanup Guide

## Problem
Even after deleting the employee collection, employees are still showing in the admin user page because they exist in the `users` collection with `userType: 'employee'`.

## Solution

### 1. Complete Data Cleanup

Run the comprehensive cleanup script to remove all employee data:

```bash
cd scripts
node completeEmployeeCleanup.js
```

This script will:
- ✅ Delete all employees from `users` collection
- ✅ Delete all employees from `employees` collection (if it exists)
- ✅ Remove employees from Firebase Auth
- ✅ Unassign jobs from deleted employees
- ✅ Provide a summary of cleanup actions

### 2. Swipe-to-Delete Feature

The admin employees page now includes:
- **Swipe left** on any employee card to reveal delete option
- **Safety checks** to prevent deleting employees with active jobs
- **Automatic job reassignment** for completed jobs

### 3. Enhanced Employee Management

#### Delete Protection
- Employees with active jobs (In Progress/Assigned) cannot be deleted
- System will show warning with job count
- Must reassign or complete jobs first

#### Clean Deletion Process
1. Swipe left on employee card
2. Tap "Delete" button
3. Confirm deletion in alert dialog
4. System automatically:
   - Removes employee from users collection
   - Unassigns from completed jobs
   - Updates job status to "Pending" if needed

### 4. Verification

After running cleanup:
1. Check admin employees page - should show "No employees found"
2. Verify Firebase Console:
   - `users` collection should have no `userType: 'employee'` documents
   - `employees` collection should be empty or deleted
3. Check job assignments are properly cleared

### 5. Fresh Start

To create new employees after cleanup:
1. Use "Add Employee" button in admin dashboard
2. New employees will be properly created in `users` collection
3. Can be managed with swipe-to-delete functionality

## Technical Details

### Collections Affected

## Notes
